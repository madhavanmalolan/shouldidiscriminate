## How to use?
- Visit [https://shouldidiscriminate.org](https://shouldidiscriminate.org) 
- Click a picture of a person and check if you should discriminate against her/him.
- Do as the app says.
- Share a screenshot with friends.
- Spread awareness.

## Why (spoiler alert)
The app always says no. It says no through various quotes on equality. Because, that is the truth. There is never any person, for any reason for one to be discriminated against.

This is a fun way to spread awareness. A simple photo and a quote makes it shareable on social media and is a great way to get the word out. This is our small contribution.

## Help
### Quotes
I've started out with a small set of quotes. I'd like to keep adding. All the quotes will be those around equality & rights. 

### Code
It's a very simple web app made using React. If you think we can add some cool features, I'd love a PR - and have it deployed.

Some request for PRs: 
- Social sharing buttons
- Donation link/button to a non profit
